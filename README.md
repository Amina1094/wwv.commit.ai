# Workforce Pulse

**Real-time AI-powered workforce & economic intelligence dashboard for Montgomery, AL.**

Built for the [World Wide Vibes Hackathon 2026](https://genai.works) | Track: **Workforce, Business & Economic Growth** | Team: **wwv.commit.ai**

## Problem

Local governments and workforce agencies lack a unified, real-time view of hiring trends, in-demand skills, and business growth signals. Decision-makers rely on lagging, fragmented data — making it difficult to align training programs with actual employer demand.

## Solution

**Workforce Pulse** is an AI-powered decision-support platform that:

- **Aggregates job postings** from LinkedIn, Indeed, USAJobs, and the Montgomery Open Data Portal via Bright Data into a single, live feed of regional hiring activity (public, federal, and private sectors).
- **Identifies hiring trends** by industry (government, defense, healthcare, manufacturing, tech, education, public safety) and tags each role by sector.
- **Monitors business growth signals** — new business filings, defense contracts, data center projects (AWS / Google / Meta), commercial real estate activity, and open-data economic indicators.
- **Tracks employer quality** via Glassdoor ratings and Google Maps local business discovery for Montgomery's key employers.
- **Maps training needs and skills gaps** by comparing in-demand skills from job descriptions against local education programs (ASU, AUM, Trenholm State, Faulkner, Huntingdon).
- **Generates policy-ready insights** via Azure OpenAI — executive policy briefs, scenario simulations ("what if a data center opens?"), and a natural-language Q&A interface grounded in real data.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools |
|---|---|
| Data Collection | **Bright Data SDK (Python)** — LinkedIn jobs/companies, Indeed, Glassdoor reviews, Google Maps, SERP API, Web Unlocker with AI extract; **Montgomery Open Data Portal**; 4 async collectors in `data_collection/` |
| AI / Analysis | **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o)** for insights, policy briefs, Q&A, and scenario simulation with retry logic; Python analysis engine with compiled regex, skills-gap detection with synonym mapping, Montgomery-aligned industry classification (10 industries) |
| Backend | **FastAPI** (`backend/`) — 14 REST endpoints with Pydantic validation, in-memory caching (30s TTL), structured logging; reads pipeline JSON, calls Azure OpenAI |
| Frontend | **Next.js 16 (App Router)** + React 18, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN-style components, Recharts, Leaflet; 9 pages, demo mode with 6-month projections, progress bar with per-stage tracking, error boundaries, keyboard-accessible navigation |
| Testing | **168 tests** (pytest + pytest-asyncio) covering API endpoints, data access, analysis, and edge cases |

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ with `uv` (or pip)
- Node.js 18+
- `.env` file (copy from `.env.example` and fill in API keys)

### Backend

```bash
# From project root
pip install -r requirements.txt   # or: uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

API at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Data Pipeline

```bash
# Run all collectors (requires Bright Data API token)
python -m data_collection.pipeline

# Or run specific collectors
python -m data_collection.pipeline --jobs --business --glassdoor --google-maps
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci        # Use npm ci (not npm install) to preserve lockfile
npm run dev
```

Dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/.env` if the API is on a different host.

### Tests

```bash
python -m pytest  # 168 tests
```
